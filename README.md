# Personal Expense Tracker

## Overview
This project is a small web application designed to track personal expenses
and gain better insight into spending habits.

## Features
- Add expenses with amount, category, and description
- Automatic calculation of total expenses
- Persistent storage using browser localStorage

## Motivation
I built this tool to better understand my own spending patterns and to practice
practical programming, data handling, and user interface design.
